* WELCOME!

What's this all about? 

These are samples in which you should be able to build against the 
pircbotcpp engine.  You should be able to go into each directory 
and build each example with either the provided Linux Makefile or 
the Windows provided Visual Studio solution file.
------------------------------------------------------------------

* [simple] sample

In this directory is a bare bones simple console example.  In a few 
lines of code it shows how to use the pircbotcpp engine with your
C++ code.
