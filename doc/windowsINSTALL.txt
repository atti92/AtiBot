* STANDARD EASIEST WAY

These are simple instructions on how to make a build 
from the source code.

Pre-reqs
========

You need to install Boost 1.33.1 or greater. 

Define the following enviornment variables: 

BOOST_INCLUDE  -- Define this to be the directory of 
                  the boost include files.

BOOST_LIB      -- Define this to the directory of 
                  the BOOST compiled release libs 

BOOST_LIBD     -- Define this to the directory of 
                  the BOOST complied debug libs.

Open up the visual studio solution: 

build_files\vs7_dll\pircbotcpp.sln 

Then do a rebuild all for either release or debug
and you should be good to go.

and exectute build_dist.bat to create a distribution
of pircbotcpp into C:\
